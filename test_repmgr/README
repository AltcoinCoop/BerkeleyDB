There are two test programs in this subdirectory.

1. db_repsite.cpp is a small, self-contained utility program, which is
   used by some of the repmgr Tcl tests.

   Building on Unix: It is not built by default; you have to "make" it
   explicitly.  One reason for this is that it is written in C++, and
   so it will only work if DB is configured with C++ support.

   This program works on Windows too.  There is an MSVC "project" file
   for it (db_repsite.dsp), but this project is not initially included
   in the Berkeley DB "solution" container.  In order to build
   db_repsite on Windows you need to add this project file to the
   "solution".  From the Solution Explorer, right-click on the
   Berkeley DB solution, and choose Add ... -> Existing Project.
   Navigate to the ./build_windows/ subdirectory and find the
   db_repsite.dsp file.


2. db_reptest (composed of db_reptest.c combined with all the other
   source files in this subdirectory) is a replication stress test.
   It exercises replication via the repmgr API.
