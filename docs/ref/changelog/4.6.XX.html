<h1 align=center>Berkeley DB 4.6.XX Change Log</h1>
<h3>Database or Log File On-Disk Format Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>New Features:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Add support for a cursor DB_PREF_DUP flag, which moves the cursor
to the previous key/data pair if it's a duplicate of the current
key/data pair. [#4801]
<li>Add verbose output tracing for filesystem operations. [#13760]

</ol>
<h3>Database Environment Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Add support to close open file handles in the case of catastrophic
database environment failure so applications that do not exit and
re-start on failure won't leak file handles. [#6538]
<li>Fix a bug that would incorrectly cause a thread to appear to be
in the Berkeley DB API after a call to db_create. [#14562]
<li>Fix a bug that could leave an environment unrecoverable if FTRUNCATE
was not set and a rollforward to a timestamp was interrupted between the
truncation of the log and the recording of aborted allocations. [#15108]
<li>Fix a bug that could cause recovery to report a "File exists"
error if a committed create was partially recovered by a previously
failed recovery operation. [#15151]
<li>Fix a bug where the DbEnv.get_thread_count method implementation was
missing from the Berkeley DB 4.5 release. [#15201]
<li>Fix a bug where replication operations were not reported properly
when the DbEnv.failchk method was called. [#15094]

</ol>
<h3>Concurrent Data Store Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>General Access Method Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>Btree Access Method Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>Hash Access Method Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>Queue Access Method Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>Recno Access Method Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>C++-specific API Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>Java-specific API Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug which can cause a JVM crash when doing a partial get
operation. [#15143]

</ol>
<h3>Java collections and bind API Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>Tcl-specific API Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>RPC-specific Client/Server Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>Replication Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a race where multiple threads might attempt to process a
LOGREADY condition. [#14902]
<li>Change the DB_VERB_REPLICATION flag to no longer require the
Berkeley DB library be built with the --enable-diagnostic configuration
option to output additional replication logging information. [#14991]
<li>Fix a bug with elections occurring during internal init of a
replication client site. [#15057]
<li>Fix lockout code to lockout message threads and API separately.
Send indication that log requests is for internal init. [#15067]
<li>Replication manager fixed to treat host-name look-up failures as
retryable, since they could be caused by transient name server outage.
[#15081]
<li>Fix a bug which led to memory corruption when the sending of a bulk
buffer resulted in an error. [#15100]
<li>A throttling limit of 10 megabytes is now set by default in a newly
created database environment (see the DbEnv.rep_set_limit method).
[#15115]
<li>Fix a bug in ALL_REQ handling where master could get a DB_NOTFOUND.
[#15116]
<li>Fix a bug which could lead to client sites repeatedly but unproductively
calling for an election, when a master site already exists. [#15128]
<li>Modify gap processing algorithsm so XXX_MORE messages ask for data
beyond what it just processed, not an earlier gap that might exist.
[#15136]
<li>Fixed a bug in the ex_rep example application which could cause the
last few transactions to disappear when shutting down the sites of the
replication group gracefully. [#15162]
<li>Fix a bug where election flags are not cleared atomically with the
setting of the new master ID. [#15186]

</ol>
<h3>XA Resource Manager Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>Locking Subsystem Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>Logging Subsystem Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>Memory Pool Subsystem Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug that could cause a checkpoint to hang if a database was
closed while the checkpoint was forcing that file to disk and all the
pages for that database were replaced in the cache. [#15135]
<li>Fix a bug where a system error in closing a file could result in a
core dump. [#15137]
<li>Fix MVCC statistics counts for private database environments. [#15218]

</ol>
<h3>Transaction Subsystem Changes:</h3>

None.

<h3>Utility Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug that prevented db_load from handling subdatabase names
that were of zero length. [#8204]

</ol>
<h3>Configuration, Documentation, Portability and Build Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Changed include files so ENOENT is resolved on Windows. [#15078]

</ol>
