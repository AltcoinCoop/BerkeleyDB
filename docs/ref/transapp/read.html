<h3 align=center>Degrees of isolation</h3>
<a name="2"><!--meow--></a>
<p>Transactions can be isolated from each other to different degrees.
<i>Serializable</i> provides the most isolation, and means that, for
the life of the transaction, every time a thread of control reads a data
item, it will be unchanged from its previous value (assuming, of course,
the thread of control does not itself modify the item).  By default,
Berkeley DB enforces serializability whenever database reads are wrapped in
transactions.  This is also known as <i>degree 3 isolation</i>.</p>
<p>Most applications do not need to enclose reads in transactions, and when
possible, transactionally protected reads at serializable isolation
should be avoided as they can cause performance problems.  For example,
a serializable cursor sequentially reading each key/data pair in a
database, will acquire a read lock on most of the pages in the database
and so will gradually block all write operations on the databases until
the transaction commits or aborts.  Note, however, that if there are
update transactions present in the application, the read operations must
still use locking, and must be prepared to repeat any operation
(possibly closing and reopening a cursor) that fails with a return value
of <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>.  Applications that need repeatable reads
are ones that require the ability to repeatedly access a data item
knowing that it will not have changed (for example, an operation
modifying a data item based on its existing value).</p>

<p><i>Snapshot isolation</i> also guarantees repeatable reads, but
avoids read locks by using multiple versions of pages.  It is a kind of
multiversion concurrency control (MVCC).  This makes update operations
more expensive, because they have to allocate space for new versions of
pages in cache and make copies, but avoiding read locks can
significantly increase throughput for many applications.  To make use of
snapshot isolation, databases must first be configured for multiversion
access by calling <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a> with the <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html#DB_MULTIVERSION">DB_MULTIVERSION</a>
flag.  The transactions or cursors must be configured with the
<a href="../../api_c/txn_begin.html#DB_TXN_SNAPSHOT">DB_TXN_SNAPSHOT</a> flag.</p>
<p>When configuring an environment for MVCC, it is important to realize
that having multiple versions of pages in cache means that working set
will take up more of the cache.  As a result, MVCC is best suited for
use with larger cache sizes.  The environment should also be configured
for sufficient transactions using <a href="../../api_c/env_set_tx_max.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_tx_max</a>.  The maximum
number of transactions needs to include all transactions executed
concurrently by the application plus all cursors configured for snapshot
isolation.  Further, the transactions are retained until the last page
they created is evicted from cache, so in the extreme case, you may need
an additional transaction for each page in the cache.</p>

<p>A transaction may only require <i>cursor stability</i>, that is only
be guaranteed that cursors see committed data that does not change so
long as it is addressed by the cursor, but may change before the reading
transaction completes.  This is also called <i>degree 2
isolation</i>.  Berkeley DB provides this level of isolation when a transaction
is started with the <a href="../../api_c/db_cursor.html#DB_READ_COMMITTED">DB_READ_COMMITTED</a> flag.  This flag may also
be specified when opening a cursor within a fully isolated
transaction.</p>

<p>Berkeley DB optionally supports reading uncommitted data; that is, read
operations may request data which has been modified but not yet
committed by another transaction.  This is also called <i>degree
1 isolation</i>.  This is done by first specifying the
<a href="../../api_c/db_open.html#DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</a> flag when opening the underlying database,
and then specifying the <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html#DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</a> flag when beginning
a transaction, opening a cursor, or performing a read operation.  The
advantage of using <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html#DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</a> is that read operations
will not block when another transaction holds a write lock on the
requested data; the disadvantage is that read operations may return data
that will disappear should the transaction holding the write lock
abort.</p>
